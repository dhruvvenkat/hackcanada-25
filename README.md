## EasyEscrow

Introducing EasyEscrow, a Web3-based escrow service to eliminate several of the costs associated with buying a new home!

Using the Internet Computer Protocol, identity-based encryption, and the vetKeys protocol, we've developed an online platform to hold home down payments in escrow while a smart contract is executed, facilitating the exchange of a property's title and down payments and mortgage funds.
